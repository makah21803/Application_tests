A file contains a sequence of integers, stored one per line. Implement a class that facilitates iteration
over these integers.

A valid integer is a sequence of one or more digits (without leading zeros), optionally preceded by a
plus or minus sign, representing a number within the range [-1,000,000,000 1,000,000,000). We allow
spaces to appear in a line before and/or after a valid integer. Lines are separated with the line-feed
character (ASCIl code 10).

There might be lines that do not represent valid integers, e.g. 2u1, 23.9, #12, 00, ++1, 2000000000.
Such lines are considered to be comments, and should be discarded.

Define a generator function solution returning an Iterator that iterates over integers from a file
object compliant with the above format.

For an input file containing the following lines:
    137
    -104
    2 58
       +0
    ++3
    +1
     23.9
    2000000000
    -0
    five
     -1

your Iterator should return the following sequence of Integers:
[137, -104, 0, 1, 0, -1]

Assume that:
    • the file can contain only line-feed characters (ASCII code 10) and printable ASCII
    characters (ASCII codes from 32 to 126).
    • for every file your iterator will be used only once.
