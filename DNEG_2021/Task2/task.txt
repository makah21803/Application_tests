An array A consisting of N integers is given. We are looking for pairs of elements of the array that are
equal but that occupy different positions in the array More formally, a pair of indices (PQ) is called
identical if 0 ≤ P<0<N and AIPIAIQ). The goal is to calculate the number of identical pairs of Indices

For example, consider array A such that

A[0] = 3
A[1] = 5
A[2] = 6
A[3] = 3
A[4] = 3
A[S] = 5

There are four pairs of identical indices: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 5) and (3, 4). Note that pairs (2.2) and (5, 1)
are not counted since their first indices are not smaller than their second.

Write a function:
    def solution (A)

That, given an array A of N integers, returns the number of Identical pairs of Indices.

If the number of identical pairs of indices is greater than 1,000,000,000, the function should return
1,000,000,000

For example, given:
A[0] = 3
A[1] = 5
A[2] = 6
A[3] = 3
A[4] = 3
A[5] = 5

the function should return 4, as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

    • N is an Integer within the range 10..100,000);
    • each element of array A in an integer within the range [-1,000,000,000..1,000,000,000].
